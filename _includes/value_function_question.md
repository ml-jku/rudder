The LSTM is the value function at time $$t$$, but based on the $$\Delta$$ sub-sequence up to $$t$$. The LSTM prediction can be decomposed into two sub-predictions. The first sub-prediction is the contribution of the already known $$\Delta$$ sub-sequence up to $$t$$ to the return (backward view). The second sub-prediction is the expected contribution of the unknown future sequence from $$t+1$$ onwards to the return (forward view). However, we are not interested in the second sub-prediction, but only in the contribution of $$Î”$$ at time $$t$$ to the prediction of the expected return. The second sub-prediction is irrelevant for our approach. We cancel the second sub-prediction via the differences of predictions. The difference at time $$t$$ gives the contribution of $$\Delta$$ at time $$t$$ to the expected return.

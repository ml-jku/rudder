We started this research project with using LSTM as a value function, but we failed. We investigated LSTM as a value function for our example task (artificial task (II) in the paper). At the time point when RUDDER has already solved the task, the LSTM error was still too large to allow learning via a value function. The problem is the large variance of the returns at the beginning of the sequence which hinders LSTM learning (forward view). The LSTM learning was initiated by propagating back prediction errors at the sequence end, where the variance of the return is lower (backward view). These late predictions initiated the storing of key events at the sequence beginning even with high prediction errors. The redistributed reward at the key events led RUDDER solve the task. Concluding: at the time point when RUDDER has already solved the task, the early predictions are not learned due to the high variance of the returns. Therefore using the predictions as value function does not help (forward view).
